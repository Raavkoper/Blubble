## Introduction

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game Wolfenstein 3D, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way. This project is a part of the 42 school curriculum in which we were not allowed to use any external libraries except for the ones that were provided by the school, and we had to write code according to the 42 norm.

After compilation, run `./cub3d maps/<preferred_map>` to start the game.
